How long did you spend working on this project?

  4 hours

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

  Adding a feature to create an ascii bar chart to show products purchased by zip code

What two additional features did you build? Why?

  1) Add ability for customer to return a Transaction -- This allows for a more realistic shopping simulation
  2) added new demographic data to the Customer class -- More data allows to insight into how/why purchase are made
    a) age
    b) zip_code
  3) Added new find methods to the transaction class -- This makes it easier to slice the data
  4) Added new error for transaction not found -- Used when looking for transaction involved in a return
  5) Create a new Chart class -- Allows insight into purchasing patterns
    a) created a single method to draw a bar chart to show products purchased by zip code

Where do you still have room to grow?

  There could be better and more error handling.  It would be cool to add more charts and more demogrpahic data.
  It would be nice to DRY up some of the find methods in the transaction class.
